/**
 *  `NBJMergeLayout` is a view that, when added to a view, adds all of its
 *  subviews to that view and removes itself. The power of the `NBJMergeLayout`
 *  view comes when it's used as the root view in a Nib and that Nib is loaded
 *  as the root view of a custom view or control. In this case it removes an
 *  unnecessary view from the resulting view hierarchy.
